For the dough:

    1) Take khoya in a bowl. Mash it very well. There should be no lumps. You can also grate and then mash the khoya.

    2) Then add grated paneer, sooji, all purpose flour, baking powder and cardamom powder to the mashed khoya. There should be no lumps in the mixture

    3) Mix well. Add milk and gather together to form a dough with milk. Donâ€™t knead. Just gently mix. If you are unable to form balls or if the mixture appears dry, then add a few teaspoons of milk.

    4) Cover the dough and keep aside for 30 mins.

    5) Make small balls from the dough. Cover the balls and keep aside.

For the sugar syrup:

    1) Dissolve sugar in water.
    
    2) Heat the sugar solution till it become sticky. You just need to switch off the fire before the syrup reaches a one thread consistency.

    3) Add rose water and stir.
    
    4) Keep the sugar solution aside. 
    
    5) On cooling if the sugar syrup crystallizes, then just add 2 to 3 tbsp water and warm the syrup again. It will again return to a liquid state.

Frying:

    1) Meanwhile, while the sugar syrup is cooking, heat oil till it is medium hot.
    
    2) Lower the flame and wait for a minute. 
    
    3) Then gently place the dough balls in the oil.

    4) Once they start to have tiny golden spots, rotate them in the oil, so that all the jamuns are evenly browned.

    5)Remove the fried jamun and then drain them on kitchen paper towels to remove excess oil.

Final steps:

    1) Then place the hot fried dough balls in the sugar syrup. Continue frying the rest of the dough balls in batches.
    
    2) When all the jamuns are placed in the sugar syrup, then keep the whole pan with the sugar syrup and the gulab jamun, on a low flame for 1 to 2 minutes till the jamun becomes soft.

    3) Heating helps the gulab jamun to absorb the syrup and become soft. The jamun slightly increases in size. Overcooking may break the jamun

    4) Use a large pan, so that the jamuns are not overcrowded and you can easily stir them gently while they are simmering.

    5) Serve gulab jamuns at any temperature-they ar delicious any way. Garnish with rose petals or almond slivers.
